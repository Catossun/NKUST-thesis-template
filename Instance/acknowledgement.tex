Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Bing-Hong Liu for the continuous support of my
Ph.D study, patience, providing me all sage, and making sure I got through the Ph.D. My special thanks go to Mei-Jun Lin, who has given me so much help for period of studying abroad in Taiwan. I would like to thank my friend, Ting-Yu Shih. She was always there cheering me up and stood by me through the good times and bad.

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank all professors of Department of Electronic Engineering
for their insightful comments and encouragement, for guiding my research for the past several
years and helping me to develop my research background.

My sincere thanks goes to Institute of Electronic Engineering and Office International Affairs
for providing me an opportunity to get the scholarship during Ph.d study process.
Without they precious support it would not be possible to conduct this research.
I would also like to thank my colleagues in the the Wireless Networking and Distributed Computing Lab
who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted the research.

I would like to thank all of my friends in National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, who have made
the past five years so enjoyable. The Ph.D would have been a very different experience
without their friendship and support.

Finally, I also take this opportunity to express gratitude to my parents for the unceasing encouragement, support and attention. They were always supporting me and encouraging me with their best wishes.
